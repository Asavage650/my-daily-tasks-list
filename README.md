# Work Day Scheduler 
## I added the javascript needed for this application to function properly for the user. Most of the HTML and all of the CSS was previously provided by the repo, I only added a few divs to the HTML and all the javascript. This assignment helped me understand local storage syntax and dates/time through dayjs. It also helped add to my knowledge of different types of javascript that can be done. This scheduler can help users oragnize their tasks throughout their work day by the hour so no task can be forgotten about or side tracked, and if you didn't finish todays tasks then the local storage of the application can save previous tasks in the browsers local storage so you won't forget what you wrote the day before.

## Credits
## This code derived from the starter code provided within module 5. The CSS was 100% complete already and the HTML was almost all finished as well. I only added the javascript and spme HTML elements. I also had help from Alexis Javier from the tutoring site as well as another tutor from slack.
